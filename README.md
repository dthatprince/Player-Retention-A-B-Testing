A/B Testing &amp; Player Retention analysis to investigate the impact on player retention.

The goal of this project is to conduct an A/B testing and player retention analysis on Cookie Cats game dataset to investigate the impact of certain factors on player retention in a game. 
Player retention is a crucial metric in the gaming industry, as it directly correlates with the success and growth of a game. 
By understanding the factors that influence player retention, game developers can make informed decisions to optimize player engagement and enhance the overall gaming experience.



##  Project Description: A/B Testing & Player Retention Analysis

## Introduction:
The goal of this project is to conduct an A/B testing and player retention analysis to investigate the impact of certain factors on player retention in a game. Player retention is a crucial metric in the gaming industry, as it directly correlates with the success and growth of a game. By understanding the factors that influence player retention, game developers can make informed decisions to optimize player engagement and enhance the overall gaming experience.

## Objectives:

Conduct A/B testing: Implement A/B testing methodology to compare the effects of different game elements on player retention. Specifically, we will focus on the placement of a gate obstacle within the game at different levels.

Analyze player retention: Measure and analyze player retention rates, specifically 1-day and 7-day retention, as key indicators of player engagement and satisfaction.

Evaluate the impact of gate placement: Compare retention rates between the A/B groups to determine the influence of gate placement on player retention. Specifically, we will compare the impact of setting the gate at level 30 versus level 40.

## Methods:

- A/B Testing: Randomly assign players to two groups, the control group with the gate at level 30 and the experimental group with the gate at level 40. Collect data on player retention for both groups over a specified time period.

- Data Collection: Gather relevant data, including the number of game rounds played, in-game purchases, and demographic information, to gain a comprehensive understanding of player behavior and engagement.

- Retention Analysis: Calculate and compare 1-day and 7-day retention rates for each A/B group. Perform statistical analysis, such as bootstrapping, to assess the significance of the observed differences in retention rates.

- Interpretation and Conclusion: Analyze the results to draw meaningful insights. Determine whether there is a statistically significant difference in player retention between the two gate placement levels. Provide recommendations based on the findings to optimize player retention.

## Expected Outcome and Benefits:
This project aims to provide valuable insights into the impact of gate placement on player retention. The expected outcome is to identify the optimal level for gate placement to maximize player engagement and increase overall retention rates. The benefits of this analysis include:

Improved player experience: By understanding the relationship between gate placement
